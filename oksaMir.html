        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
          My name is Oksana. I live in České Budějovice where I moved to in 2015
          with my family.<br />

          I've been a private English(EFL) teacher for more than 15 years. Along
          with that I tried myself in the clothing design industry. Creating
          outfit for Dance sport was the best part of my experience in this
          field.<br />
          Times changes. I decided to take a new challenge and try myself in
          STEM(Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) which I tended
          to after high school but decided not to chose as my future
          occupation.<br />
          In the end of 2020 I took an intensive course of QA from Czechitas(DA
          Testování) and after it went on my IT education with DA Web. I feel
          very excited about my future. I beleive that I've made a perfect
          choice.
