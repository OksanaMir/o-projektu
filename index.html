          Hi there! This page is going to tell you about our team and our
          project. So, let's start.

          We are two Ukrainian girls, <a href="sashaSha.html">Sasha</a>(<i
            >shortened from Ukrainian Oleksandra</i
          >) and <a href="oksaMir.html">Oksana</a>, who decided to change their
          lives completely. The first brave step was to move to Czech Republic,
          which was not an easy decision. New language. New culture. Families
          and friends are faraway now. The second brave step was to change our
          occupation. But we aren't afraid of challenges. We love them.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          We met at Czechitas and decided to become a team to create our final
          project at
          <a href="https://www.czechitas.cz/cs/co-delame/digitalni-akademie"
            >DA Web</a
          >. The name of our team is <strong class="teamName">OlOx</strong>.
          It's made by putting two first letters of our first names together.

        <h2>What is our project about?</h2>
        <p class="description">
          We are among the people who believe that an IT project is a
          construction that must be built from the right details. Our project is
          aimed to create an online shop webpage for coffee brand Naftee. We
          hope it would be not only a commercial place but also the one socially
          oriented. Lots of people drink coffee but not everyone knows enough
          about it and only few feel at home with it. We would like to share
          with others our knowledge about how to chose coffee correctly.
