    <h1>Our project</h1>

    <p class="description">
      Hi there! This page is going to tell you about our team and our project.
      So, let's start.
    </p>

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <img class="teamPic" src="images/OlOx.jpg" alt="OlOx" />
    <a class="toProfile" href="sashaSha.html">Oleksandra</a>
    <a class="toProfile" href="oksaMir.html">Oksana</a>

    <p class="description">
      We are two Ukrainian girls, <a href="sashaSha.html">Sasha</a>(<i
        >shortened from Ukrainian Oleksandra</i
      >) and <a href="oksaMir.html">Oksana</a>, who decided to change their
      lives completely. The first brave step was to move to Czech Republic,
      which was not an easy decision. New language. New culture. Families and
      friends are faraway now. The second brave step was to change our
      occupation. But we aren't afraid of challenges. We love them.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      We met at Czechitas and decided to become a team to create our final
      project at
      <a href="https://www.czechitas.cz/cs/co-delame/digitalni-akademie"
        >DA Web</a
      >. The name of our team is <strong class="teamName">OlOx</strong>. It's
      made by putting two first letters of our first names together.
    </p>
    <h2>What is our project about?</h2>
    <p class="description">
      We are among the people who believe that an IT project is a construction
      that must be built from the right details. Our project is aimed to create
      an online shop webpage for coffee brand Naftee. We hope it would be not
      only a commercial place but also the one socially oriented. Lots of people
      drink coffee but not everyone knows enough about it and only few feel at
      home with it. We would like to share with others our knowledge about how
      to chose coffee correctly.
