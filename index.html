          who decided to change their lives completely. The first brave step was
          to move to Czech Republic, which was not an easy decision. New
          language. New culture. Families and friends are faraway now. The
          second brave step was to change our occupation. But we aren't afraid
          of challenges. We love them.

        <h2>About project</h2>
        <p class="description">
          We are among the people who believe that an IT project is a
          construction that must be built from the right details. Our project is
          aimed to create an online shop webpage for coffee brand Naftee. We
          hope it would be not only a commercial place but also the one socially
          oriented. Lots of people drink coffee but not everyone knows enough
          about it and only few feel at home with it. We would like to share
          with others our knowledge about how to chose coffee correctly.

        <h2>Naftee coffee shop</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Brand Naftee has been on the market for more than two years. The
          online shop was created by the website constructor - Wix, which works
          on a simplified templates page development. SEO promotion is the most
          difficult part of the tamplates e-shops. And we also need to update
          site design and functionality that will be based on a current UX
          trends. Accordingly, there was a need to create an online coffee shop
          with the help of new specialists.
