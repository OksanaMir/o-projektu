      <h1>About myself</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Sasha Shapovalova. </br>
        I was born in Kiev. And now I’ve been living in the Czech Republic for almost 2.5 years. The reason we moved was because my husband and I wanted to create a brand with the specialty coffee. Kyiv has become the capital of coffee, but in South Bohemia the concept of "third wave coffee" has just started to develop. With more than 7 years of marketing experience, I have decided that the promotion of the new brand will not be a problem. When sales started to improve, the era of COVID-19 began. But giving up is not my style. And so we decided to give a new breath to our brand. There are lots of plans, but we’ll start by creating a usability online coffee shop. So I decided to open a new side of myself - front-end development. 
        My perfect accomplices will be Oksana, Vera and, of course, the incredible Czechitas team. 
        It's time to change yourself and the world around. </br>
